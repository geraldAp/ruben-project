          As mental health care providers, the University Counseling Center
          (UCC) staff are ethically and legally required to uphold standards of
          confidentiality. Students utilizing our services have a right to
          confidentiality and to expect that their involvement with the UCC and
          information shared in the context of counseling will be protected.
          Confidentiality is very important to the success of the therapeutic
          process and we take it very seriously.
        </p>
        <p>
          Confidentiality of our services means the UCC will not release any
          information about a student’s involvement in counseling without a
          signed release of information form. There are several exceptions to
          confidentiality that students need to be aware of. The UCC is required
          to release information without a student’s authorization: (a) if we
          believe that a child or vulnerable adult is being or has been
          subjected to abuse or neglect, we may be required to file a report
          with the appropriate government agency; (b) if we believe you are a
          danger to yourself, we are obligated to seek hospitalization or to
          contact others who can help provide protection; (c) if we believe you
          are a threat to others, we are required to take protective actions
          which may include notifying the potential victim, contacting the
          police, or seeking hospitalization for you; or (d) as otherwise
          required by law. The exceptions to confidentiality are rare. If any of
          these exceptions should occur, it is the UCC's policy that, whenever
          possible, we will discuss any action being considered with you.

          Please be aware the UCC and University Health Services (UHS) operate

          Treatment Form, you give the departments permission to consult with
          each other to provide you with the best care possible. These
          consultations are for treatment and/or professional training purposes
          only. Information will not be disclosed to any University department

          For students under the age of 18, Indiana law requires that a parent
          or guardian give permission for you to receive mental health treatment
          services. he UCC will work with you to obtain this consent.

        <p>
          All UCC records are separate from any other student records at the
          University, and no record of a student’s contact with the UCC is
          placed on any transcript or academic record. A student’s UCC records
          are destroyed 7 years after the last date of service.
